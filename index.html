            <p>YWe, humans, had conventionally been into organic food since ages. Then there came an era when the
                population stats soared high, and the food demands peaked. We saw famines and malnutrition that invoked
                a need to develop and implement novel methods to increase the yield up to several times the existent
                total produce.
